# Module 1: Data Preparation

This module outlines the process of preparing data for a generative AI application. The implementation is organized into the following folder structure, with each step detailed below.

## Folder Structure
- `.git`: Version control directory.
- `1-1-openai`: Contains implementation for OpenAI embeddings.
- `1-2-ollama`: Contains implementation for open-source embeddings (e.g., Hugging Face models like LLaMA 3).
- `3-2-DataIngestion`: Handles loading data from various sources (PDFs, Excel files, JSON files, images, videos, URLs) using Langchain.
- `3-3-DataTransformer`: Manages splitting ingested data into smaller chunks to fit within language model context windows.
- `4-Embeddings`: Converts text chunks into vector representations using embedding techniques (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.).
- `5-VectorStore`: Stores vectors in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB, AstraDB) for efficient retrieval.

## Complete Steps Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Purpose**: Load data from diverse sources to prepare it for processing.
- **Sources**: PDFs, Excel files, JSON files, images, videos, and URLs.
- **Implementation**: The `3-2-DataIngestion` folder contains scripts and configurations for ingesting data using Langchain. This step ensures all raw data is accessible for further transformation.
- **Note**: Upcoming videos will demonstrate the data ingestion process with Langchain.

### 2. Data Transformation (Splitting into Chunks)
- **Purpose**: Break down large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks to fit within the context window limitations of language models.
- **Details**: For example, content from 1000 PDFs can be too large to process as a single unit. Splitting into chunks allows effective processing and retrieval by the model.
- **Implementation**: The `3-3-DataTransformer` folder includes tools and code to perform this transformation, ensuring each chunk is appropriately sized.
- **Note**: This is a critical data transformation technique to optimize model performance.

### 3. Embedding
- **Purpose**: Convert text chunks into numerical vector representations for similarity search.
- **Why Vectors?**: Text is transformed into vectors, enabling algorithms like cosine similarity to identify relevant chunks based on vector comparisons.
- **Techniques**: 
  - OpenAI embeddings (implemented in `1-1-openai`).
  - Open-source embeddings (e.g., Hugging Face models like LLaMA 3, implemented in `1-2-ollama`).
  - Other options like Google Gemini Pro embeddings (to be explored).
- **Implementation**: The `4-Embeddings` folder houses the embedding generation logic, integrating the techniques from `1-1-openai` and `1-2-ollama`.
- **Note**: Upcoming videos will delve into these embedding techniques in detail.

### 4. Vector Store (Vector Database)
- **Purpose**: Store the generated vectors efficiently for quick retrieval during similarity searches.
- **Examples**: Pinecone, ChromaDB, AstraDB.
- **Implementation**: The `5-VectorStore` folder contains configurations and scripts to manage vector storage and retrieval, ensuring scalability and performance.
- **Note**: This step is essential for enabling fast and accurate data retrieval in the generative AI workflow.
